  <h1>Limits</h1>
  <p>Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of change and motion. Limits are a 
  fundamental concept in calculus and are used to define the behavior of functions as they approach values that might seem 'impossible'</p>  
    
  <p>In calculus, a limit is the value that a function approaches as its input (usually denoted by x) 
    gets closer and closer to a particular value (usually denoted by a). This is denoted mathematically as:</p>
    <p><center>$$\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$$</center></p>
    <p>where f(x) is the function being evaluated, x is the input variable, a is the limit point, 
      and L is the limit value.</p>
<p>Limits play a crucial role in calculus, as they allow us to define important concepts such as continuity, differentiability, and 
  integration. They also help us to understand the behavior of functions in a more precise manner, allowing us to make predictions and draw conclusions about their properties.</p>
  <p>For example, consider the function f(x) = <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>x</sub>. As x approaches 0, the function value becomes larger and larger in magnitude. We can say that the limit of f(x) as x approaches 0 is infinity, denoted as:</p>
<p><center>$$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1}{x} = \infty$$</center></p>
<p>This means that the function grows without bound as x approaches 0.</p>
<h3>Practice Problem: Finding a Limit to Infinity</h3>
<p>Let's practice a problem with a limit to infinity:</p>
<p>Let's consider the function \(f(x) = \frac{3x^2 - 5x + 7}{2x^2 + 3x - 2}\) as x approaches infinity.</p>
<p>To find the limit of the function as x approaches infinity, we need to evaluate the behavior of the function as x becomes very large. 
  We can do this by dividing the numerator and denominator by the highest power of x in the function, which in this case is x<sup>2</sup>:</p>
<p><center>$$f(x) = \frac{3x^2 - 5x + 7}{2x^2 + 3x - 2} = \frac{3 - \frac{5}{x} + \frac{7}{x^2}}{2 + \frac{3}{x} - \frac{2}{x^2}}$$</center></p>
<p>As x becomes infinitely large, the terms  <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>x</sub> and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>x<sup>2</sup></sub> becomes practically 0 as the denominator grows to infinity. This means that:</p>
<p><center>$$\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = \frac{3+0+0}{2+0+0}$$</center></p>
<p>Therefore, the limit of the function f(x) as x approaches infinity is <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.</p>

  <h1>Derivatives</h1>
  <p>Derivatives are a fundamental concept in calculus and are used to study the rate at which functions change. In calculus, the derivative of a function represents its instantaneous rate of change at a given point.</p>
<p>The derivative of a function <i>f(x)</i> at a point <i>x</i> is defined as:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>$$f'(x) = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$
</i></p>
<p>where <i>h</i> is a very small value that approaches zero. The derivative represents the slope of the tangent line to the curve of the function at a given point. It can be used to find the maximum or minimum value of a function and to optimize various problems.</p>
<h3>Finding the Derivative</h3>
<p>To find the derivative of a function, we need to take the limit of the difference quotient as <i>h &rarr; 0</i>. Let's take a look at a few examples.</p>
<h4>Example 1: Finding the Derivative of a Linear Function</h4>
<p>Let's find the derivative of the function <i>f(x) = 2x + 1</i> at the point <i>x = 3</i>.</p>
<p>First, we need to compute the difference quotient:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">$$\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} = \frac{(2(x+h)+1)-(2x+1)}{h} = \frac{2h}{h} = 2$$</p>
<p>Next, we take the limit of the difference quotient as <i>h &rarr; 0</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">$$f'(x) = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} = 2$$
</p>
<p>Therefore, the derivative of <i>f(x) = 2x + 1</i> at the point <i>x = 3</i> is <i>f'(3) = 2</i>.</p>
<h4>Example 2: Finding the Derivative of a Quadratic Function</h4>
<p>Let's find the derivative of the function <i>f(x) = x<sup>2</sup> - 3x + 2</i> at the point <i>x = 2</i>.</p>
<p>First, we need to compute the difference quotient:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">$$\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} = \frac{((x+h)^2 - 3(x+h) + 2) - (x^2 - 3x + 2)}{h} = \frac{2xh + h^2 - 3h}{h} = 2x - 3 + h$$
</p>
<p>Next, we take the limit of the difference quotient as <i>h &rarr; 0</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">$$f'(x) = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} = 2x - 3$$
</p>
<p>Therefore, the derivative of <i>f(x) = x<sup>2</sup> - 3x + 2</i> at the point <i>x = 2</i> is <i>f'(2) = 1</i>.</p>
<h3>Real-World Applications of Derivatives</h3>
<p>Derivatives are used in many fields, including physics, engineering, economics, 
  and finance, to analyze rates of change and optimize various problems. Here are some examples:</p>
<h4>Example 1: Physics</h4>
<p>In physics, derivatives are used to calculate velocity and acceleration. Velocity is the derivative 
  of position with respect to time, and acceleration is the derivative of velocity with respect to time. For 
  example, if we know the position function of an object, we can use derivatives to find its velocity and acceleration at any given time.</p>
<h4>Example 2: Economics</h4>
<p>In economics, derivatives are used to analyze the elasticity of demand for a product. Elasticity measures 
  the responsiveness of the quantity demanded to changes in price. The price elasticity of demand is defined 
  as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price. The derivative is 
  used to calculate the elasticity, as it represents the rate of change of quantity demanded with respect to price.</p>
<h4>Example 3: Finance</h4>
<p>In finance, derivatives are used to manage risk and optimize investments. For example, options are financial
   derivatives that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined 
   price at or before a specific date. The value of an option depends on the price of the underlying asset, the strike price, 
   the time to expiration, and the volatility of the underlying asset. Derivatives are used to calculate the sensitivity of 
   the option value to changes in these variables, which helps investors manage risk and optimize their investments.</p>
<p>Derivatives are a powerful tool in calculus and are used to analyze rates of change and optimize various problems in many 
  different fields. Understanding derivatives is essential for students of calculus and for professionals in fields that use calculus.</p>
  <h3>Optimization Example: Maximizing Area</h3>
<p>Let's consider an optimization problem where we want to find the dimensions of a rectangle with a fixed perimeter that maximizes its area. The perimeter of a rectangle with length l and width w is:</p>
<p><center>$$P = 2l + 2w$$</center></p>
<p>Since the perimeter is fixed, we can write:</p>
<p><center>$$2l + 2w = P \Rightarrow l + w = \frac{P}{2}$$</center></p>
<p>The area of a rectangle with length l and width w is:</p>
<p><center>$$A = lw$$</center></p>
<p>To find the dimensions of the rectangle that maximizes its area, we need to find the values of l and w that satisfy the constraint l + w = P/2 and maximize the area A.</p>
<p>Using the constraint, we can write:</p>
<p><center>$$l = \frac{P}{2} - w$$</center></p>
<p>Substituting this expression for l into the area formula, we get:</p>
<p><center>$$A = w\left(\frac{P}{2} - w\right) = \frac{Pw}{2} - w^2$$</center></p>
<p>To find the value of w that maximizes the area A, we need to take the derivative of the area function with respect to w and set it equal to zero:</p>
<p><center>$$\frac{dA}{dw} = \frac{P}{2} - 2w = 0$$</center></p>
<p>Solving for w, we get:</p>
<p><center>$$w = \frac{P}{4}$$</center></p>
<p>Substituting this value for w back into the constraint equation, we get:</p>
<p><center>$$l = \frac{P}{4}$$</center></p>
<p>Therefore, the dimensions of the rectangle that maximizes its area with a fixed perimeter are l = <sup>P</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> and w = <sup>P</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>.</p>

  <h1>Integrals</h1>
	<p>Integrals are one of the fundamental concepts in calculus, used to calculate the area under a curve or the total change of a function over an interval. In this article, we will explain what integrals are, how to find them, and their real-world applications.</p>
	
	<h2>Definition of Integrals</h2>
	<p>An integral is a mathematical concept that represents the area under a curve. To find the integral of a function f(x) over an interval [a,b], we divide the interval into many small sub-intervals of width Î”x, and approximate the area of each sub-interval using a rectangle. By summing up all the areas of the rectangles, we obtain an estimate for the total area under the curve. As we make the width of the sub-intervals smaller and smaller, the estimate becomes more and more accurate, and approaches the exact value of the integral.</p>
	<p>The symbol used to represent an integral is âˆ«, and the integral of a function f(x) over an interval [a,b] is denoted as:</p>
	<p style="text-align: center;">âˆ«<sub>a</sub><sup>b</sup> f(x) dx</p>
	<p>The notation dx indicates the variable of integration, and represents the infinitesimal width of each sub-interval. The limits of integration, a and b, represent the starting and ending points of the interval over which we are integrating the function.</p>
	<h2>The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</h2>
<p>The fundamental theorem of calculus is a fundamental concept in calculus that relates differentiation and integration. It has two parts:</p>
<h3>Part 1</h3>
<p>The first part of the fundamental theorem of calculus states that if a function f(x) is continuous on the closed interval [a, b], and F(x) is the antiderivative of f(x), then:</p>
<p>$$ \int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a) $$</p>
<p>That is, the definite integral of a function over a closed interval is equal to the difference between the antiderivative of the function evaluated at the upper and lower limits of integration.</p>
<h3>Part 2</h3>
<p>The second part of the fundamental theorem of calculus states that if F(x) is differentiable on an open interval I, and f(x) is its derivative, then:</p>
<p>$$ \frac{d}{dx} \int_{a}^{x} f(t) dt = f(x) $$</p>
<p>That is, the derivative of the definite integral of a function is equal to the function itself.</p>
<p>Together, the two parts of the fundamental theorem of calculus provide a powerful tool for evaluating definite integrals and finding antiderivatives.</p>
	<h2>Finding Integrals</h2>
  <p>There are various techniques for finding integrals, including:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Integration by substitution: This technique involves substituting a variable in the integral with a new variable that simplifies the expression. For example:</li>
    <p style="text-align: center;">âˆ« 2x cos(x<sup>2</sup>) dx</p>
    <p>We can let u = x<sup>2</sup>, so that du/dx = 2x, and dx = du/2x. Substituting these into the integral, we get:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">âˆ« cos(u) du/2 = (1/2) sin(u) + C = (1/2) sin(x<sup>2</sup>) + C</p>
    <li>Integration by parts: This technique involves choosing two functions and applying the product rule of differentiation. For example:</li>
    <p style="text-align: center;">âˆ« x e<sup>x</sup> dx</p>
    <p>We can choose u = x and dv/dx = e<sup>x</sup>, so that du/dx = 1 and v = e<sup>x</sup>. Applying the integration by parts formula, we get:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">âˆ« x e<sup>x</sup> dx = x e<sup>x</sup> - âˆ« e<sup>x</sup> dx = x e<sup>x</sup> - e<sup>x</sup>
  </ol>
  <h2>Find the Volume generated by revolving a function around the x-axis</h2>
  <p>We want to find the volume of the solid obtained by revolving the curve y = x<sup>2</sup> between x = 0 and x = 1 about the x-axis.</p>

  <p>Step 1: Write the formula for the volume of a solid of revolution.</p>
  
  <p>V = &#960;/5 * (1<sup>2</sup> - 0<sup>2</sup>) = &#960;/5</p>
  
  <p>Step 2: Substitute 'y = x<sup>2</sup>' in the formula for the volume:</p>
  
  <p>V = &#960;/5 * &#8747;<sub>0</sub><sup>1</sup> (x<sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup> dx</p>
  
  <p>Step 3: Evaluate the integral:</p>
  
  <p>V = &#960;/5 * &#8747;<sub>0</sub><sup>1</sup> x<sup>4</sup> dx</p>
  
  <p>V = &#960;/5 * [(1/5) x<sup>5</sup>] <sub>0</sub><sup>1</sup></p>
  
  <p>V = &#960;/5 * [(1/5) - 0] = &#960;/25</p>
  
  <p>Therefore, the volume of the solid obtained by revolving y = x<sup>2</sup> between x = 0 and x = 1 about the x-axis is &#960;/25 cubic units.</p>
